* Adding files
* Committing changes
* Branch creation
* Branch switching
* Merging branches
* Viewing commit history

## Objectives

* Understand the internal working of Git.
* Implement file tracking and version history.
* Understand commit and branch management.
* Implement basic merging functionality.
* Learn how file contents are stored using hashes.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3
* OOP
* JSON
* Unix/File Handling
* Bash
* OS Module
* git

## Installation
* python3
* Git 
* Linux, Ubuntu(Windoes), macOs

  python3 diff.py --cached
  diff.py displays unstaged changes.
  diff.py --cached displays staged changes.

* python3 branch.py
  It shows our current branch

* python3 branch.py <branch_name>
  This creates a new branch 

* python3 switch.py <branch_name>
  This switches the branch

* python3 merge.py <branch_name>
  This command merges the branches

* python3 log.py
  This command shows all the commit history of your minigit including time and date

* python3 restore.py <file_name>

## Internal Working

* .minigit/: Hidden directory that stores all internal version-control information.
* objects/: Stores file contents and commit objects.
* refs/heads/: Stores branch references and their latest commit hashes.
* HEAD: Identifies the currently selected branch.
* index: Maintains information about files added to the staging area.
